<h1>Library Management System</h1>

This project was developed using the Yii2 framework and was designed to facilitate the management of a physical library's operations.

<h2>Overview of Features</h2>

The system is intended for a physical library, enabling the management of staff and readers via a secure web platform. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to govern the permissions of administrators, employees, and readers.

Readers must register on the platform to reserve books. Once a reservation is made, the reader is required to collect the books from the physical library within 24 hours, where they will be issued by library staff. Readers are given a one-month loan period to return borrowed items, with each stage of the process tracked through the system.

The library operates with limited inventory, and readers are restricted to borrowing a maximum of 10 books at a time. Any books not returned within the designated time frame are flagged as overdue.

Employees are granted the ability to add, remove, or modify records for books and readers.

Administrators have exclusive authority to assign admin or employee roles to registered users.

Both administrators and employees may also act as readers, with the ability to borrow books following the same process as regular users.

The system includes two-factor authentication (2FA) via Google Authenticator for enhanced security.
